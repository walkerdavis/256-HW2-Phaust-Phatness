##Controls
-dial 1(from left) rotary slider specifies frequency of the saw waves
-dial 2(second from left) rotary slider specifies frequency of cutoff filter
-dial 3(third from left) rotary slider specifies Q of filter
-dial 4(right) rotary slider specifies output gain



##Potential Improvements/things I do not know how to do
-add labels to sliders that bend around rotary knob
-add MIDI in capabilities to play with keyboard/controller
-knowlingly adjust position of knobs, not just lucky guessing
