# 256A-Phaust-Phatness
## Walker Davis
### Instructors: Romain Michon and Tim O'Brien

### *Disclaimer:*  This is my second coding project ever.  Coding practices are not good, design is pretty subpar, but the remix at the end of the [Youtube Product Demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uWXSWEAAABk) is pretty hot.


## Controls
-dial 1(from left) rotary slider specifies frequency of the saw waves
-dial 2(second from left) rotary slider specifies frequency of cutoff filter
-dial 3(third from left) rotary slider specifies Q of filter
-dial 4(right) rotary slider specifies output gain



## Potential Improvements/things I do not know how to do
-add labels to sliders that bend around rotary knob
-add MIDI in capabilities to play with keyboard/controller
-knowlingly adjust position of knobs, not just lucky guessing
